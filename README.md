🔴 Red: Occupied (person in seat)
🟢 Green: Empty seat
🔵 Blue: Backpack/belongings only

Use Left/Right arrow keys while hovering over a seat to cycle through these statuses.
🔧 Advanced Features
These features were built for other parts of the chapel-attendance project - you may not need them for basic data entry.
Batch Operations

Mass rename: Right double-click + drag to rename multiple boxes relative to a manually named reference box
Move all boxes: Use W, A, S, D keys to move the entire seating layout at once

View Options

Toggle visibility: Press H to show/hide all seat boxes
Set reference name: Press U to name the upper-left seat (used for auto-naming other seats)

File Operations

Open new data set: Press O or use File -> Open to switch to a different folder

📁 Data Structure
The tool automatically maintains a seats.csv file that updates in real-time as you make changes. This file contains the seating layout and occupancy data for analysis.
🎨 About the Interface
The interface has a retro aesthetic - it wasn't originally designed for sharing, but we're grateful for your help with this project! Despite its simple appearance, it's a functional tool for efficient data collection.
